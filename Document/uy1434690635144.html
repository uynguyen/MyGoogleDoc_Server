<p>After you&#39;ve successfully created a <code>URL</code>, you can call the <code>URL</code>&#39;s <code>openStream()</code> method to get a stream from which you can read the contents of the URL. The <code>openStream()</code> method returns a 
<a class="APILink" target="_blank" href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html"><code>java.io.InputStream</code></a> object, so reading from a URL is as easy as reading from an input stream.</p>
<p>The following small Java program uses <code>openStream()</code> to get an input stream on the URL <code>http://www.oracle.com/</code>. It then opens a <code>BufferedReader</code> on the input stream and reads from the <code>BufferedReader</code> thereby reading from the URL. Everything read is copied to the standard output stream:</p>

<p>When you run the program, you should see, scrolling by in your command window, the HTML commands and textual content from the HTML file located at <code>http://www.oracle.com/</code>. Alternatively, the program might hang or you might see an exception stack trace. If either of the latter two events occurs, you may have to <a href="_setProxy.html"> set the proxy host</a> so that the program can find the Oracle server.</p>
